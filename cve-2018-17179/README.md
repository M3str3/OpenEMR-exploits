# PoC CVE-2018-17179 
Just a script for my TFM

## Description
This script is a proof of concept (PoC) for exploiting the CVE-2018-17179 vulnerability in OpenEMR. The vulnerability allows SQL injection in the OpenEMR administration module, which can lead to the exposure of sensitive information stored in the system's database.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `beautifulsoup4` library (can be installed with `pip install beautifulsoup4`)

## Usage
The script runs from the command line and requires certain parameters to function correctly. Below are the steps for its execution:

### Arguments
- `-t`, `--target`: Target server IP or domain (required).
- `--ssl`: Use HTTPS instead of HTTP.
- `--debug`: Enable debug mode to see more details during execution.
- `--table`: Export a specific table from the database (optional).

### Example Commands
#### Check for Vulnerability and Dump the Entire Database
```shell
python cve-2018-17179.py -t example.com --ssl
```
#### Dump a Specific Table
```
python cve-2018-17179.py -t example.com --ssl --table users
```

### Script Functionality
- Vulnerability Detection: The script attempts to detect the installed version of OpenEMR to verify if it is vulnerable.
- Table Enumeration: If the version is vulnerable, the script enumerates the tables in the database.
- Data Extraction: The script extracts data from the specified tables or from all tables if no specific table is mentioned.
- Save Data: The extracted data is saved in CSV files in the data directory.

### Notes
This script is a proof of concept and should only be used for educational purposes and in controlled environments where explicit permission to perform security testing has been obtained. Misuse of this script on unauthorized systems may be illegal and is strictly prohibited.
