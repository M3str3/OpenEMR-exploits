![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e968021-0575-4bae-befc-ecb3b2fc35aa)

This directory contains a Proof of Concept (PoC) for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) exploits. The PoC is organized as follows:

## Directory Structure

- `server/`: Contains PHP scripts to serve content and potentially steal cookies or other sensitive information.
- `payloads/`: JavaScript payloads designed for XSS attacks.
- `cve-xxxx-xxxx/`: Each folder corresponds to a specific CVE, containing `exploit.py` scripts to demonstrate the exploit.
