## Description
This script is a proof of concept (PoC) for exploiting the CVE-2018-1000219 vulnerability in OpenEMR. The vulnerability allows for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), which can be used to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Usage
The script runs from the command line and requires certain parameters to function correctly. Below are the steps for its execution:

## Arguments
- `-t`, `--target`: Domain of the OpenEMR installation (required).
- `--ssl`: Use HTTPS instead of HTTP.
- `--user`: Username for authentication (optional).
- `--password`: Password for authentication (optional).
- `--payload`: Path to JS file or JavaScript string (optional, default: `alert("M3str3")`).

## Example Command
```shell
python exploit.py -t example.com --ssl --user admin --password admin123 --payload 'alert("M3str3")'
```

## Script Functionality
- Authentication: The script can authenticate to the OpenEMR system using the provided credentials.
- XSS Injection: The script constructs a URL containing the XSS payload and sends a request to the vulnerable endpoint.
-  Response: The script checks if the payload was successfully executed by analyzing the server's response and prints the result.

## Notes
This script is a proof of concept and should only be used for educational purposes and in controlled environments where explicit permission to perform security testing has been obtained. Misuse of this script on unauthorized systems may be illegal and is strictly prohibited.
